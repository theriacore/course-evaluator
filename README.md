# Course Evaluator AI

## Project Overview

Course Evaluator AI is an automated system that evaluates AI-generated educational content against textbook content using semantic similarity techniques.

The system analyzes whether AI-generated explanations properly cover important concepts from a textbook and generates an evaluation report with coverage scores and recommendations.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

- Extract content from educational PDFs
- Process and clean extracted text
- Divide textbook content into meaningful chunks
- Compare AI-generated answers with textbook sections
- Measure content coverage using AI-based semantic similarity
- Generate evaluation reports and visual summaries

## Features

### 1. PDF Text Extraction

- Extracts textbook content automatically
- Supports educational PDF documents


### 2. Text Cleaning

Removes unnecessary formatting and prepares text for analysis.


### 3. Intelligent Chunking

Divides large textbook content into smaller sections for detailed evaluation.


### 4. AI Semantic Comparison

Uses sentence embeddings to compare meaning instead of only matching words.

Technology:

- Sentence Transformers
- Cosine Similarity


### 5. Coverage Evaluation

Each section is classified as:

| Score | Evaluation |
|---|---|
| 85%+ | Excellent Coverage |
| 70-85% | Strong Coverage |
| 50-70% | Moderate Coverage |
| Below 50% | Needs Improvement |


### 6. Report Generation

Generates:

- Evaluation report
- Weak section identification
- Recommendations


### 7. Visualization Dashboard

Creates:

- Topic-wise similarity charts
- Evaluation summary
